# Working Guidelines

## 1. Branching Strategy
Start from dev branch: When starting any work, always create your branch from the dev branch.
Branch naming convention:
* For new features: feat/feature-name
* For bug fixes: fix/whatyouarefixing
* For updating content: update/whereyouareupdating
* For documentation updates: docs/whatyouupdated
* For refactoring code: refactor/whatyourefactored
* For urgent hotfixes: hotfix/urgentfix

## 2. Pull Request (PR) Workflow
### Step 1: Development
After completing your task, push your changes and create a PR to merge your branch into the dev branch.
Provide a clear description of the changes in the PR.
### Step 2: Testing
Test your code locally before creating a Pull Request merge with the main.
```
bun run deploy
```
# For Windows systems use wsl
```
wsl --install
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install unzip
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
**Verify Installation**
```
bun --version
```
**Now test the deployment locally**
```
bun run deploy
```

### Step 3: Production
After successful testing, create a PR from the test branch to the main branch.
## 3. Commit Message Guidelines
Use the following prefixes for clear and consistent commit messages:

```
feat: for new features.
fix: for bug fixes.
docs: for documentation updates.
refactor: for code refactoring.
style: for formatting and style changes (not affecting code logic).
test: for adding or updating tests.
chore: for maintenance tasks.
```
```
Example: feat: add user authentication to login page.
```
## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
The CI/CD pipeline must run error-free.
Both ESLint checks and Next.js build must pass successfully for the PR to be valid.
## 5. Conflict Resolution
If any merge conflicts arise, contributors should immediately contact CTO for resolution.
## 6. PR Review Time
All PRs should be reviewed and resolved within 5 days of submission.

### Deployed on CloudFlare
Frigus Fiesta is deployed on Cloudflare for enhanced speed, security, and scalability.
